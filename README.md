Identifying functionally important cell states and structure within a heterogeneous tumor remains a significant biological and computational challenge. Moreover, current clustering or trajectory-based computational models are ill-equipped to address the notion that cancer cells reside along a phenotypic continuum. To address this, we present Archetypal Analysis network (AAnet), a neural network that learns key archetypal cell states within a phenotypic continuum of cell states in single-cell data.
