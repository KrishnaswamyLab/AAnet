## AAnet v.s. other archetypal analysis methods on tetrahedron projected onto a sphere. 
The projection adds nonlinearity such that the archetypes in the ambient space no longer correspond to the ground truth archetypes. Only AAnet is able to account for this nonlinearity, a feature that exists in many real-world datasets.
